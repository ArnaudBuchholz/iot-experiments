## Arduino

You need [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) to compile and upload your programs.

## Tested component

### Wemos D1 miniPro

The [Wemos D1 miniPro](https://www.wemos.cc/product/d1-mini-pro.html) is cheap and has an inbuilt wifi board.
Make sure to read the [Get started in Arduino](https://www.wemos.cc/tutorial/get-started-arduino.html)
*(After installing the drivers, you may also need to install the
[direct access drivers](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/direct-access-drivers))* 

You must install [python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/).
Quick note (for windows): if python is not available from the command line,
[add it to the path](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9546324/adding-directory-to-path-environment-variable-in-windows)

**Check your USB cable!**

If you are on windows and you don't hear the blip when plugging the device, maybe the cable doesn't connect all wires.
